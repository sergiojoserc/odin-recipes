    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I grew up in the Canal Zone and sancocho is a must for large family meals. Sancocho is a Latin chicken soup with cilantro and yuca (or cassava). Keep in mind, there are a variety of recipes out there this is just the one my nanny used to make us.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>9 cups water</li>
       <li>1 whole chicken</li>
       <li>2 plantains, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
       <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
       <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
       <li>5 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
       <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
       <li>3 pounds yuca (cassava) roots, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
       <li>6 small red potatoes, quartered</li>
       <li>1 (15.25 ounce) can corn, drained</li>
       
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        <li>Combine water, chicken, plantains, onion, cilantro, garlic, and salt in a large pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium; cook until chicken is longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
        <li>Remove the chicken and let cool. Add yuca, potatoes, and corn to the soup; cook over medium heat until yuca and potatoes are softened, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <Strong>Step 3</Strong>
        <li>Discard chicken skin and bones. Place meat back into the soup; stir to combine.</li>
    </ol>
